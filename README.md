#### Memory. Tested.

How much can you remember?

Flash. Lights. tests your ability to remember sequences of colors and challenges you to repeat advanced combinations in a fun and colorful environment optimized for desktop web and mobile devices.

Flash. Lights. was made to pay homage to the classic children's game Simon and to test my ability to design and implement fun, intuitive and beautiful software and my ability to work with responsive design.

#### Gameplay

1) Once the game begins, the user is shown a pattern of flashing tiles.

2)After the pattern has been displayed, the user must click the tiles in the same order displayed in order to pass the round.

3)The user can input a maximum of **ten wrong patterns** before the game ends and the user is asked if they would like to try again.

4)If the user inputs five correct patterns, the game goes to the next level, with more squares for each level

5)After progressing through all the levels, the user wins the game! They are then given the option to play again.

#### Technologies Used

In addition to the three main front end web languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript; this game takes advantage of the jQuery and Animate.css libraries to create a smooth and easy to navigate user experience. My goal with the user interface of this project was to create as minimal and Spartan project as possible, something that can get out of the user's way and allow them to concentrate on the game.
